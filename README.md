# Algorithm Visualizer!


## Description

Algorithm Visualizer is a web application built using React.js that allows you to interactively visualize sorting algorithms and the Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm. It provides an engaging way to understand the inner workings of these algorithms and how they process data.

## Features

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort.
- Explore the Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid.
- Customize array size, speed, and grid dimensions for a tailored experience.
- Step-by-step and real-time visualization modes for in-depth learning.
- Beautiful and intuitive user interface.
